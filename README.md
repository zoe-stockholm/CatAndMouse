The scene is an urban park; a cat watches a mouse run around the base of a statue of the first computer. Over the course of a minute, the somewhat witless mouse moves one meter counterclockwise around the statue’s base, which is circular and 2 meters in diameter. Every minute, the cat pursues the mouse as follows:

    If the cat can see the mouse, the cat moves 1 meter toward the statue.
    If the cat can’t see the mouse, the cat circles 1.25 meters counterclockwise around the statue. 

The cat plans eventually to get close enough to the mouse to make it a juicy lunch. The mouse by accident, however, may manage to keep completely out of sight of the cat, since both the cat and the mouse are moving counter-clockwise. Should the chase go on more than 30 minutes, however, the cat will get tired and wander off.
